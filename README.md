# Data Projects Repository
Welcome to my Data Projects Repository, where I showcase various projects I've worked on in the field of data analysis and modeling.

Contents:
1. Data Preparation and Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This section includes techniques and processes for preparing raw data, handling missing values, correcting data types, and resolving data quality issues. Additionally, the project focuses on visualizing and exploring data to extract meaningful insights. This involves identifying patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.

2. Linear Regression Models: Contains projects where I've built and evaluated linear regression models to predict outcomes based on input data. Includes the use of regularization techniques such as Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net.
